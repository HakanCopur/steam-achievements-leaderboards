## How the plugin uses Steamworks

- All Steamworks headers/libraries are referenced from the Unreal Engine installation (Engine/Source/ThirdParty/Steamworks).

## Build integration

  - `AddEngineThirdPartyPrivateStaticDependencies(Target, "Steamworks");`
  - `WITH_STEAMWORKS` macro guards direct Steamworks usage in `.cpp` files.
- No Steamworks files are packaged with the plugin.

## Runtime requirements
- The consuming project must enable **Online Subsystem** (and typically **Online Subsystem Steam**).
- A valid **Steam AppID** and Steamworks configuration are required for Steam features.
